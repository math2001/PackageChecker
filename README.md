# PackageChecker

Due to the amount of pull requests on the [package_control_channel](https://github.com/wbond/package_control_channel), @FichteFoll had the idea to created [some automated tests](https://github.com/packagecontrol/package_reviewer).

They're good, the only problem is that it's not compatible with Sublime Text Python's version.
